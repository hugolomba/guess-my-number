# 🎯 Guess My Number

A simple and fun number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.
- The player tries to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game gives feedback: too high, too low, or correct.
- The player starts with 20 points and loses 1 point for each wrong guess.
- If the player wins, the background changes and the number is revealed.
- There's also a **highscore system** to track the best result.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic)
